## 💡 Lighting Setup (2 Speedlight Configuration)

### The "Clamshell + Fill" Setup (Best for Reference Photos)

**Speedlight 1 - KEY LIGHT (Main Light)**
- Position: 45° to your right, slightly above eye level (about 6-7 feet high)
- Distance: 4-5 feet from you
- Power: 1/4 to 1/2 power (adjust based on test shots)
- Modifier: Shoot through umbrella or softbox if you have one (creates softer shadows)
- Purpose: Primary light source, defines your facial features

**Speedlight 2 - FILL LIGHT (Shadow Reducer)**
- Position: 45° to your left, at face level
- Distance: 5-6 feet from you (slightly farther than key light)
- Power: 1/8 to 1/4 power (about half the key light power)
- Modifier: Umbrella or bounce off a white wall/reflector
- Purpose: Fills in shadows, creates even lighting

**Why This Works:**
- Even lighting across your face = AI can see all features clearly
- Minimal harsh shadows = better feature recognition
- Replicates professional studio lighting = clean, consistent look

## 📷 Camera Settings

### Ideal Settings:
- **ISO**: 100-200 (low for maximum quality)
- **Aperture**: f/5.6 to f/8 (keeps entire face in sharp focus)
- **Shutter Speed**: 1/160 to 1/200 (syncs with speedlights)
- **White Balance**: Flash (5500K) or custom white balance
- **Format**: RAW if possible, or highest quality JPG
- **Focus**: Single-point autofocus on your eyes

### Using Your Phone Instead?
If using iPhone/smartphone:
- Use Portrait mode disabled (you want natural depth)
- Turn OFF HDR
- Tap to focus on your face
- Use the rear camera (better quality)
- Use timer or remote to avoid camera shake

---

## 🎭 Background Setup

**Best Background:**
- **Solid neutral color**: Gray, white, or black
- **Why**: AI focuses on YOU, not background elements
- **DIY**: Use a bedsheet, poster board, or blank wall
- **Distance**: Stand 3-4 feet away from background (prevents shadows)

**Avoid:**
- Busy patterns, posters, windows
- Cluttered rooms
- Anything that distracts from your face

---

## 👔 What to Wear

**Clothing Rules:**
1. **Solid colors** - No busy patterns
2. **Neutral tones** - Black, white, gray, navy (matches most thumbnail scenarios)
3. **What you'd wear on camera** - If you typically wear a hoodie, wear that. If you wear button-ups, wear that.
4. **Consistent across all 5 photos** - Wear the same outfit for all reference shots

**Pro Tip:** Wear what represents your "brand" - this becomes your default look in thumbnails.

## 📸 The 5 Required Photos

### Photo 1: FRONT FACING - Neutral Expression
- **Angle**: Look directly at camera
- **Expression**: Neutral/slight smile (relaxed, natural)
- **Head Position**: Straight on, no tilt
- **Why**: Primary reference for facial structure

### Photo 2: FRONT FACING - Big Smile
- **Angle**: Look directly at camera
- **Expression**: Genuine smile (show teeth)
- **Head Position**: Straight on
- **Why**: Captures your smile for happy/excited thumbnails

### Photo 3: 3/4 VIEW - Right Side
- **Angle**: Rotate body 30-45° to the right, turn head slightly back toward camera
- **Expression**: Neutral
- **Head Position**: Eyes still looking at camera
- **Why**: Shows facial structure from different angle

### Photo 4: 3/4 VIEW - Left Side
- **Angle**: Rotate body 30-45° to the left, turn head slightly back toward camera
- **Expression**: Neutral
- **Head Position**: Eyes still looking at camera
- **Why**: Completes the angle coverage

### Photo 5: FRONT FACING - Expressive
- **Angle**: Look directly at camera
- **Expression**: Your signature thumbnail expression (shocked, excited, pointing, whatever you do most)
- **Head Position**: Straight on
- **Why**: Captures your personality and common thumbnail poses

## 🎬 Step-by-Step Shoot Process

### Setup Phase (15 minutes)
1. **Set up background** - Hang sheet or position yourself against blank wall
2. **Position speedlights** - Key light high-right, fill light mid-left
3. **Set camera on tripod** - At your eye level, 6-7 feet away
4. **Get dressed** - Your "on brand" outfit
5. **Test shot** - Take one photo, check exposure

### Testing Your Lighting (5 minutes)
1. Take test shot at camera settings above
2. Check the photo:
   - Is your face evenly lit? (No harsh shadows on one side)
   - Can you see details in shadows? (Not too dark)
   - Are highlights blown out? (Not too bright)
3. Adjust speedlight power if needed:
   - Too dark = increase key light power
   - Too bright = decrease power or step back
   - One side too shadowy = increase fill light

### The Shoot (10 minutes)
1. **Set camera timer** (10-second delay) or use remote
2. **Position yourself** in front of background
3. **Take Photo 1** - Front neutral
   - Camera clicks → check result → retake if needed
4. **Take Photo 2** - Front smile
5. **Rotate right** → Take Photo 3
6. **Rotate left** → Take Photo 4
7. **Take Photo 5** - Front expressive

**Total Time: 30 minutes**

## 🚀 Once You're Done

1. **Select your best 5 photos** from the shoot
2. **Save them to** `reference photos/` folder
3. **Test the script:**
   ```bash
   python thumbnail-generator.py "excited expression pointing at camera"
   ```
4. **Never change these photos again** - consistency is key!

## 🔄 When to Retake Reference Photos

Only retake your reference set if:
- You've had a major appearance change (haircut, facial hair, glasses)
- You've upgraded to much better equipment
- You're rebranding your channel's look

Otherwise, stick with your original set for maximum consistency!

## 📞 Troubleshooting

**Problem: One side of face is too dark**
→ Solution: Increase fill light power or move it closer

**Problem: Face is too shiny/reflective**
→ Solution: Use powder/mattifying product, or increase distance from key light

**Problem: Background has shadows**
→ Solution: Move farther from background (3-4 feet minimum)

**Problem: Eyes look dark/shadowed**
→ Solution: Lower the key light slightly or add small reflector below face level

**Problem: Colors look weird**
→ Solution: Set white balance to "Flash" or 5500K
